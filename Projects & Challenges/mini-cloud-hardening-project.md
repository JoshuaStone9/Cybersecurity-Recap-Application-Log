# Mini Cloud Hardening Project

## Objective
Strengthen the security posture of a small AWS deployment through configuration and monitoring.

## Tasks
- Harden IAM policies and remove unused roles.  
- Enable GuardDuty and Config for detection.  
- Validate S3 bucket policies and encryption.

> 📝 Add screenshots or findings from your cloud environment.

## Reflection
Hardening even small environments demonstrates attention to detail and secure defaults.

## Next Steps
- Build repeatable hardening scripts with Terraform.  
- Compare pre- and post-hardening metrics.
