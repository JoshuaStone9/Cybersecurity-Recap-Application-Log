# Data Encryption Lab

## Objective
Explore data encryption at rest and in transit using AWS KMS and SSL/TLS.

## Activities
- Encrypt S3 buckets and EBS volumes.  
- Test decryption permissions.  
- Enable HTTPS and monitor traffic with Wireshark.

> 📝 Add screenshots or notes from your encryption tests.

## Reflection
Encryption ensures that even if breached, data remains unreadable to unauthorised users.

## Next Steps
- Automate encryption enforcement scripts.  
- Document compliance impact.
