## Reflection
### How did today’s learning support real-world SBS use cases?  

Today's learning directly supports real-world scenarios within SBS by strengthening automation, security monitoring, cloud management, and incident response capabilities. Each skill area covers tasks which are required in modern IT, cybersecurity, and cloud-driven organisations. I have recapped existing knowledge within this area as well as learning new skillsets which I can now use within the future.

The growing skills I have gained in PowerShell and Bash mean I can now automate everyday SBS tasks more easily such as creating user accounts, running audits, collecting logs for compliance and keeping servers healthy with regular checks and maintenance thanks to additional research and learning.

Learning Boto3 improves my ability to automate AWS tasks like managing EC2 instances, handling S3 backups, auditing IAM users, updating security groups and monitoring costs, this is all mostly newly gained knowledge which will need to be expanded upon to confidently understand which can be looked at a later date, This helps SBS environments keep their cloud setup secure, efficient, and low-maintenance.

I learned how to read CloudTrail and SIEM logs, giving me the skills to spot issues like compromised accounts, misconfigured S3 buckets, unauthorised IAM changes, malware activity, and data exfiltration. In an SBS environment with limited tools this ability will help to manually analyse logs which is essential for catching threats early and responding effectively. This Skillset is new and will need to be expanded upon.

Understanding security automation tools like GuardDuty, Sentinel, and Splunk enables you to help build workflows that detect suspicious activity, create incidents automatically, notify the SOC, block malicious IPs, and correlate alerts. This is especially valuable in SBS environments that rely on automation to compensate for smaller security teams.

I learned how automated patching tools like Patch Manager, Update Manager and Automox streamline updates across systems, reduce security risks, minimise downtime and generate compliance reports. This is crucial for SBS environments to stay secure and meet insurance and compliance requirements.

#### Overall Summary

Today's learning directly strengthens your ability to:

✔ Automate routine admin and security tasks
✔ Detect and analyse real-world security incidents
✔ Manage cloud resources efficiently
✔ Respond to threats with rapid, automated workflows
✔ Keep systems patched, compliant, and secure

These are high-value, real-world skills that SBS environments depend on to stay secure, efficient, and scalable with limited resources.


### What skill should I reinforce tommorow?

Reflect On Skills Represented In Today's Session To Reinforce & Carry On With Other Skill Recap Tasks.

Research more into AWS automation tools to confidently understand them.

Research more into CloudTrail and SIEM logs to better understand the most efficent way to use them.
