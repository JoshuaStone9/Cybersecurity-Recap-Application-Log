### How did today’s learning support real-world SBS use cases?  

Today’s learning directly supports real-world SBS use cases by giving me hands-on practice with scenarios that mirror daily responsibilities. 

Completing a mock risk assessment for the AWS Marketplace Management Portal helped me understand how to evaluate security risks, apply governance standards and think through mitigation strategies. 

This kind of practical exercise strengthens my ability to apply the same process confidently and accurately when performing actual day-to-day tasks at SBS.
