# Week 4 Recap

## Overview
Week 4 combined cloud and business perspectives. I evaluated risk within SBS-style systems and practised incident response workflows.  

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Simulated a ransomware response scenario.  
- Explored AWS GuardDuty alerts and CloudWatch dashboards.  
- Reviewed risk registers and control mapping under ISO 27001.  

## Reflection
Incident response readiness depends on both tools and teamwork.  
Understanding cloud-native detection helps connect technical indicators with business recovery actions.

## Next Steps
- Review monthly progress.  
- Identify next focus areas for development (e.g., SIEM, AI threat analytics).
