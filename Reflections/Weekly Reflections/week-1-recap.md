# Week 1 Recap

## Overview
This week focused on revisiting core cybersecurity concepts and re-establishing a structured learning routine.  
Topics included penetration testing fundamentals, AWS cloud setup, and reviewing GDPR compliance principles relevant to SBS Insurance Services.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Reviewed penetration testing workflow (recon → exploitation → reporting).  
- Practised AWS IAM setup and access control verification.  
- Revisited GDPR data handling and encryption standards.  
- Created a personal learning schedule and baseline for future weeks.

## Reflection
Week 1 set the foundation for consistent learning. I strengthened my understanding of compliance-driven cybersecurity, particularly how it ties to data protection in insurance contexts.

## Next Steps
- Continue refining daily structure.  
- Begin Week 2 cloud and network recap modules.  
- Document lessons in the daily tracker.
