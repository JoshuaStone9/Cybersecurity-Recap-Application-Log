# Week 2 Recap

## Overview
This week deepened my understanding of network and vulnerability management, focusing on real-world application.  
I explored how vulnerabilities are prioritised and resolved within an organisation like SBS Insurance Services.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Conducted vulnerability scans using OpenVAS.  
- Reviewed patch management workflows and risk reporting.  
- Analysed sample network traffic in Wireshark.  
- Reflected on network segmentation strategies for claims and portal systems.

## Reflection
Week 2 highlighted how proactive maintenance (patching, monitoring, and scanning) directly prevents incidents.  
I’m becoming more comfortable aligning technical remediation with business impact.

## Next Steps
- Build an internal lab for repeated scanning and patch validation.  
- Begin preparing for cloud security exercises.
