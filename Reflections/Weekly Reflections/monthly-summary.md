# Monthly Summary

## Overview
This month has established a strong foundation in both technical and governance areas of cybersecurity.  
Focus areas included penetration testing, AWS cloud security, automation, and compliance under GDPR.

## Highlights
- Built consistent study habits using the daily tracker.  
- Completed three lab environments for testing (OpenVAS, AWS sandbox, Wireshark).  
- Documented improvements in risk assessment and response planning.

## Reflection
The month reinforced how continuous recap builds mastery.  
By combining technical work with structured reporting, I’m now approaching problems with both a defensive and strategic mindset.

## Next Steps
- Begin planning the next month’s roadmap: SIEM integration, AWS Security Hub, and fraud-detection analysis.  
- Maintain weekly reflections to track progression.
