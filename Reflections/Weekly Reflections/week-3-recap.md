# Week 3 Recap

## Overview
The focus this week was on automation and scripting within AWS. I began integrating PowerShell and Python into security processes.  
This improved efficiency and demonstrated how automation can strengthen compliance for regulated data environments.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Built AWS CLI automation scripts for auditing IAM users.  
- Created PowerShell scripts to manage local patching schedules.  
- Reviewed CI/CD integration options for secure deployment.  

## Reflection
Automation has transformed repetitive security checks into proactive governance.  
It reinforces that compliance and efficiency can coexist when tasks are properly scripted.

## Next Steps
- Extend automation to vulnerability management.  
- Start container and serverless security learning next week.
