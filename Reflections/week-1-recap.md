# Week 1 Recap

## Overview

This week was all about building up my core skills in Compliance & Risk, Scripting & Automation and Cloud/Security Monitoring. I revisited things I already knew while also picking up new concepts that fit directly into the kind of work done in an SBS environment.

The tasks I completed helped strengthen my confidence in areas like risk assessments, automation, cloud operations, log analysis and working with security tools. All of these are really important for day-to-day IT and cybersecurity work.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Got a clearer understanding of risk assessments and cloud governance  
- Reinforced my scripting skills in PowerShell and Bash  
- Learned the basics of automating AWS tasks with Boto3  
- Improved my ability to read and interpret CloudTrail and SIEM logs  
- Learned more about security automation tools  
- Expanded my knowledge of patching, compliance, and system health  
- Applied everything I learned to real SBS-style tasks and scenarios

## Reflection

This week helped me strengthen a lot of the core skills that directly support real work within an SBS environment. Revisiting Compliance & Risk gave me a better understanding of how to approach real assessments and think through risks in a structured way. Doing the mock risk assessment helped me put governance principles into practice something that translates well into actual day-to-day responsibilities.

Scripting and automation was another big part of the week. By getting more hands-on with PowerShell and Bash, I’m now more comfortable automating routine tasks like log collection, audits and system checks. Learning Boto3 also opened the door to automating AWS tasks, which will help reduce manual work and make cloud workflows more reliable.

Digging into CloudTrail and SIEM logs helped me understand how to spot suspicious or unusual behaviour. This kind of log analysis is important for early threat detection, especially in environments where automation and manual review need to work hand-in-hand.

I also explored security automation tools and patch management solutions. This highlighted how important it is to keep systems secure, updated and compliant—especially for SBS organisations with fewer resources or smaller teams. Automating some of these processes can make a big difference in reducing risk and improving response time.

Overall, this week helped reinforce what I already knew while also introducing new skills that will help me work more confidently and independently. The mix of risk assessment, scripting, cloud automation and log monitoring has given me a stronger foundation to build on as I continue developing professionally.
