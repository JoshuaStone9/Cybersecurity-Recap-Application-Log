# Scripting & Automation (Recap & Application)

## Overview
Scripting enables repeatable and efficient execution of security and administrative tasks.  
In AWS, scripting complements automation by managing logs, resources, and compliance at scale.

## Core Skills Recapped
- **PowerShell & Bash:** Automating system configurations.  
- **Python (Boto3):** Managing AWS resources via scripts.  
- **Log Analysis:** Parsing CloudTrail and SIEM logs.  
- **Security Automation:** Triggering alerts, patching, and reporting.

## Tools Used
- **Python / Boto3 SDK** – AWS automation scripting.  
- **PowerShell** – Windows automation and auditing.  
- **AWS CLI** – Command-line resource management.  
- **Crontab / Task Scheduler** – Routine job execution.

## Practical Application / Lab Work
- Built Python scripts to audit IAM roles and policies.  
- Automated log downloads from CloudTrail for local analysis.  
- Created PowerShell scripts to manage EC2 tagging and patching.  
- Integrated scripts with GitHub for version control.

## SBS Relevance
SBS can leverage scripting to:  
- Automatically check for misconfigurations or unencrypted data.  
- Schedule compliance checks for GDPR reporting.  
- Streamline backups, logging, and report generation.

## Reflection
Scripting turns routine tasks into reliable, automated processes.  
It boosts efficiency and reduces security gaps.

## Next Steps
- ✅ Expand Python AWS automation skills.  
- ✅ Learn JSON/YAML handling for IaC integration.  
- ✅ Combine scripting with vulnerability scanning automation.
