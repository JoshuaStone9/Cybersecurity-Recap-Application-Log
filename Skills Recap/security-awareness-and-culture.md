# Security Awareness & Culture (Recap & Application)

## Overview
Security awareness and culture focus on empowering employees to recognise and respond to threats effectively.  
Human behaviour is often the weakest link in cybersecurity, so building awareness is key to resilience.

## Core Skills Recapped
- **Phishing Awareness:** Identifying and reporting suspicious messages.  
- **Password Hygiene & MFA:** Promoting strong authentication habits.  
- **Social Engineering Prevention:** Recognising manipulation tactics.  
- **Security Policy Communication:** Writing clear, engaging guidance.  
- **Continuous Training:** Regular refresher sessions and microlearning.

## Tools Used
- **KnowBe4 / Cofense** – Phishing simulation platforms.  
- **Microsoft 365 Defender Training.**  
- **Internal newsletters and awareness posters.**  

## Practical Application / Lab Work
- Designed a short awareness presentation for non-technical users.  
- Created a mock phishing campaign to test response rates.  
- Drafted an employee security policy summary.

## SBS Relevance
SBS relies on trust and data confidentiality.  
A strong security culture ensures:  
- Employees protect claim data responsibly.  
- Reduced risk of phishing, credential theft, or data leakage.  
- Compliance with GDPR’s accountability principles.

## Reflection
Revisiting this topic reminded me that technology can’t secure a business alone — people must be engaged and aware.

## Next Steps
-  Build a small-scale phishing simulation lab.  
-  Explore behavioural change techniques in security training.  
-  Contribute to awareness campaign planning in future roles.
