# Identity & Access Management (Recap & Application)

## Overview
Identity and Access Management (IAM) ensures the right individuals have the right access to the right resources — securely and efficiently.  
It underpins modern cybersecurity strategy and compliance, especially for cloud environments.

## Core Skills Recap
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assigning roles based on least privilege.  
- **Authentication & Authorisation:** Implementing MFA, SSO, and conditional access policies.  
- **Account Lifecycle Management:** Provisioning, reviewing, and revoking access.  
- **Privileged Access Management (PAM):** Securing administrative accounts.

## Tools To Use
- **Azure AD / AWS IAM** – Role and permission management.  
- **Okta / Duo** – Identity federation and MFA.  
- **LDAP / ADUC** – On-prem identity management.  
- **PowerShell** – Access audit automation.

## Practical Application / Lab Work
- Configured IAM policies in AWS restricting S3 access to specific roles.  
- Simulated account lifecycle management with automatic deprovisioning.  
- Tested MFA enforcement and conditional access rules.

## SBS Relevance
IAM directly supports SBS’s security posture by controlling:  
- Who can view or edit customer claim data.  
- Remote access for employees and partners.  
- Compliance with GDPR’s **“data access limitation”** principle.

## Reflection
IAM is the foundation of trust without it, every system is exposed.  
Recapping IAM reinforced the importance of continuous review and monitoring of permissions.

## Next Steps
-  Complete AWS and Azure IAM hands-on labs.  
-  Learn automation with PowerShell and Terraform.  
-  Study Zero Trust identity models.
