# Threat Intelligence (Recap & Application)

## Overview
Threat intelligence (TI) is the collection and analysis of information about potential or current attacks targeting an organisation.  
It transforms raw data into actionable insights that help prevent, detect, and respond to threats.

## Core Skills Recapped
- **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT):** Gathering data from public sources (Shodan, VirusTotal, social media).  
- **Indicator of Compromise (IOC) Analysis:** Understanding IPs, hashes, and domains linked to attacks.  
- **Threat Modelling:** Using frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK** and **STRIDE** to assess risk.  
- **Reporting & Communication:** Translating technical findings into executive summaries.

## Tools To Be Used
- **Maltego / SpiderFoot** – OSINT and link analysis.  
- **MISP** – Threat intelligence sharing platform.  
- **VirusTotal** – Malware hash lookup.  
- **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** – Mapping attacker tactics.

## Practical Application / Lab Work
- Collect OSINT data for simulated phishing domains.  
- Map vulnerabilities to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.  
- Create mock threat-intel briefs summarising adversary behaviour trends.

## SBS Relevance
Threat intelligence enables SBS to stay ahead of risks such as:  
- Phishing campaigns targeting customers or staff.  
- Cloud misconfiguration exploitation.  
- Data exfiltration attempts via exposed APIs.

## Reflection
Effective threat intelligence isn’t just about tools — it’s about context, communication, and relevance to business operations.

## Next Steps
-  Practise MISP setup for sharing IOCs.  
-  Monitor NCSC and CISA advisories weekly.  
-  Integrate TI feeds into SIEM analysis.
