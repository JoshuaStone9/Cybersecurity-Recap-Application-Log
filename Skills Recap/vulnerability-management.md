# Vulnerability Management (Recap & Application)

## Overview
Vulnerability management is the continuous process of identifying, assessing, prioritising, and remediating security weaknesses across systems, applications, and networks.  
Its purpose is to reduce organisational risk by ensuring that vulnerabilities are discovered and resolved before they can be exploited by attackers.  
A strong vulnerability management programme aligns with standards such as **ISO 27001**, **NIST SP 800-40**, and **CIS Controls**.

## Core Skills Recapped
From my degree and practical experience, I’ve revisited and refined the following areas:
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Using tools like **Nessus**, **OpenVAS**, and **Qualys** to detect misconfigurations and outdated software.  
- **Patch Management:** Coordinating with system owners to schedule and verify timely updates while minimising operational disruption.  
- **Prioritisation and Risk Scoring:** Applying **CVSS** (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) to evaluate severity and potential impact.  
- **Remediation Planning:** Creating structured patch and mitigation plans based on business context and criticality.  
- **Verification & Reporting:** Re-scanning and validating fixes, producing reports for both technical and non-technical audiences.  
- **Lifecycle Integration:** Embedding vulnerability management into **change management** and **DevSecOps** pipelines.

## Tools Used
- **Nessus / OpenVAS** – Automated vulnerability scanning.  
- **CVSS Calculator** – Assigning and understanding severity scores.  
- **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer / WSUS** – Patch compliance and verification.  
- **AWS Inspector / ScoutSuite** – Cloud-based vulnerability assessments.  
- **Excel / Power BI / Python Scripts** – Analysing and visualising scan results.  

## Practical Application / Lab Work
- Set up **OpenVAS** in a virtual lab and performed full system scans against intentionally vulnerable VMs.  
- Conducted manual verification of vulnerabilities reported by automated tools to filter out false positives.  
- Created a **patch-testing workflow** to assess potential service impacts before deployment.  
- Practised translating technical vulnerability data into clear executive summaries and risk ratings.  
- Simulated integration of scanning results into a continuous improvement cycle (scan → fix → verify → document).

## SBS Relevance
For **SBS Insurance Services**, vulnerability management is essential to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive claim and customer data.  
It supports:
- Ongoing protection of **web portals**, **cloud services**, and **internal systems** that store personal data.  
- Compliance with **GDPR** Article 32 (security of processing).  
- Reducing risk from **third-party integrations** with insurer systems.  
- Providing assurance to clients and regulators that systems are proactively maintained and secured.

## Reflection
Recapping these skills has reinforced how effective vulnerability management depends on both technology and communication.  
Identifying vulnerabilities is only part of the process — true security improvement comes from clear reporting, collaboration, and validation of remediation steps.  
It also highlighted the importance of aligning patch priorities with business impact and regulatory risk.

## Next Steps
-  Build a personal vulnerability-management lab integrating Nessus and automated patching scripts.  
-  Complete TryHackMe “Vulnerability Management” and “Cyber Defense Frameworks” paths.  
-  Learn advanced remediation automation using PowerShell and Ansible.  
-  Explore integration of vulnerability scanning with AWS Inspector and CI/CD pipelines.
