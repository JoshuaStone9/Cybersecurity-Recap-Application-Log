# Data Protection (Recap & Application)

## Overview
Data protection ensures that personal and sensitive data is processed securely, lawfully, and transparently.  
It covers confidentiality, integrity, and availability while aligning with **GDPR**, **UK Data Protection Act 2018**, and **ISO 27001**.

## Core Skills Recap
- **Encryption:** Data at rest (BitLocker, KMS) and in transit (TLS).  
- **Data Classification:** Identifying public, internal, and confidential data.  
- **Access Control:** Enforcing least privilege and MFA.  
- **Data Retention & Disposal:** Secure deletion and retention schedules.  
- **Incident Handling:** Responding to data breaches within legal timeframes.

## Tools To Be Used
- **VeraCrypt / BitLocker** – Encryption and key management.  
- **AWS S3 / RDS encryption** – Cloud data security.  
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** – Monitoring and preventing data exfiltration.  
- **GDPR compliance checklists** – Policy tracking.

## Practical Application / Lab Work
- Set up encrypted storage volumes and simulated access control tests.  
- Review GDPR articles 5 and 32 for compliance scenarios.  
- Design secure data handling flow diagrams.

## SBS Relevance

## Reflection
Data protection isn’t just about technology it’s about accountability, policies, and awareness.

## Next Steps
-  Build a mini DLP policy lab in Microsoft 365.  
-  Study GDPR breach reporting procedures.  
-  Learn about cloud key management (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault).
