# Security Operations & SIEM (Recap & Application)

## Overview
Security Operations (SecOps) focuses on detecting, analysing, and responding to cybersecurity threats in real time.  
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools centralise logs and alerts to enable visibility and response.

## Core Skills Recapped
- **Log Management:** Collecting and normalising logs from multiple systems.  
- **Alert Correlation:** Detecting patterns of compromise.  
- **Incident Triage:** Prioritising alerts by severity and context.  
- **Automation:** Using playbooks and scripts to speed up response.

## Tools Used
- **Splunk / ELK Stack** – Log collection and analysis.  
- **Azure Sentinel / AWS CloudWatch** – Cloud SIEM platforms.  
- **Security Onion** – Network traffic and IDS correlation.  
- **SOAR platforms** – Automated playbook execution.

## Practical Application / Lab Work
- Created custom Splunk dashboards visualising login anomalies.  
- Ingested Sysmon logs to detect privilege escalation attempts.  
- Built test alerts and tuned false positives.

## SBS Relevance
SBS can leverage SIEM systems to:  
- Monitor access to customer portals and internal services.  
- Detect unauthorised data exports or fraud patterns.  
- Provide compliance evidence under GDPR Article 32.

## Reflection
Security operations require continuous improvement and noise reduction.  
Recapping SIEM reinforced how visibility equals control.

## Next Steps
-  Practise with Security Onion or Splunk in a home lab.  
-  Build custom alert rules for AWS environments.  
-  Learn basic SOAR automation.
