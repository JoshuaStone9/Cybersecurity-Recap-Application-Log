# OpenVAS Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

OpenVAS is an open-source tool that scans computers and networks for security vulnerabilities. It checks for outdated software, misconfigurations, weak passwords, and exposed ports, then generates reports with severity ratings and recommended fixes. It can also run scheduled scans to continuously monitor system security.

## What It Does

### Vulnerability Scanning

- Scans systems for known vulnerabilities such as outdated software, misconfigurations, insecure services, weak passwords, etc.

- Uses a large database of Network Vulnerability Tests (NVTs).

### Network & Port Scanning

- Identifies open ports and services running on hosts.

- Helps you see what attackers could potentially reach.

### Security Assessment

- Unpatched software

- Misconfigured SSH or web servers

- Default or weak credentials

- Dangerous open ports

- Missing security headers on websites

### Reporting

Generates detailed reports showing:

- Vulnerabilities found

- Severity levels (Low / Medium / High / Critical)

- Recommended fixes

### Continuous Monitoring

- Can run scheduled scans to monitor systems over time.

- Helps track security posture and compliance.

### Integration

- Works with the Greenbone Security Assistant (web UI).

- Can be automated via CLI or API.
