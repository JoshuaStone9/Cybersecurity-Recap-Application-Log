# AI and Data Ethics in Fraud Detection

## Overview
Exploring ethical use of AI models for detecting fraud while protecting personal data.

## Ethical Considerations
1. Avoiding bias in model training.  
2. Ensuring transparency and explainability in fraud scoring.  
3. Maintaining GDPR compliance in AI data pipelines.

## Research 

1. Avoiding bias in model training

What it covers:

AI has the potential to reduce human biases, but it can also amplify them if not designed carefully. 
McKinsey & Company

Common sources of bias: historical inequalities encoded in data, proxies (e.g., zip codes, first names) that correlate with sensitive attributes like race or gender. 
Oliver Wyman

Best practices to avoid / mitigate bias:

Ensure training data is representative and diverse. 
Encord

Remove or limit features that are sensitive or act as proxies for them. 
Oliver Wyman

Use fairness metrics (e.g., disparate impact, equal opportunity) to measure bias. 
Encord

Perform bias impact assessments and continuous auditing of models in deployment. 
Brookings

Organizational recommendations:

Incorporate multidisciplinary teams (data scientists, ethicists, domain experts) to examine models and their impacts. 
McKinsey & Company

Keep humans in the loop where necessary; automated systems need oversight. 
McKinsey & Company

Why it matters: If you don’t deal with bias, the model can end up treating some groups unfairly. That means people can be denied services or flagged incorrectly which damages trust and can also get companies into legal trouble.

Key takeaway:
Avoiding bias isn’t about making a “perfectly fair” model it’s about being thorough. That means using good data, choosing features carefully, checking how the model behaves and keeping an eye on it over time.

## Reflection
Ethical AI supports trust and fairness in data-driven cybersecurity.

## Next Steps
- Review NCSC and ICO guidelines on AI ethics.  
- Create mini-case study on AI bias prevention.
