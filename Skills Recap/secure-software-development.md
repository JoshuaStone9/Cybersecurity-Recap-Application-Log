# Secure Software Development (Recap & Application)

## Overview
Secure Software Development (SSD) focuses on embedding security throughout the software lifecycle — from design to deployment.  
It ensures applications are resilient against vulnerabilities like injection, XSS, and authentication flaws.

## Core Skills Recapped
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Avoiding input validation flaws and weak authentication.  
- **Code Review & Static Analysis:** Using SAST tools to detect insecure code.  
- **OWASP Top 10 Awareness:** Understanding and mitigating common web risks.  
- **DevSecOps Integration:** Embedding security in CI/CD pipelines.

## Tools Used
- **OWASP ZAP / Burp Suite** – Application testing.  
- **SonarQube / Bandit** – Static code analysis.  
- **GitHub Actions / Jenkins** – CI/CD integration.  
- **Docker / Kubernetes** – Secure container deployment.

## Practical Application / Lab Work
- Developed a simple web app and applied OWASP best practices.  
- Integrated automated security scans into a GitHub pipeline.  
- Reviewed vulnerable applications (DVWA, Juice Shop).

## SBS Relevance
SBS relies on secure web portals and APIs for claim handling.  
SSD principles ensure:  
- Portals resist injection or authentication attacks.  
- Code changes don’t introduce vulnerabilities.  
- Compliance with GDPR’s “privacy by design” principle.

## Reflection
Security must be a design choice, not an afterthought.  
Recapping SSD reinforced my focus on proactive prevention.

## Next Steps
-  Complete OWASP Top 10 labs.  
-  Practise integrating SAST/DAST tools in pipelines.  
-  Study secure API design principles.
