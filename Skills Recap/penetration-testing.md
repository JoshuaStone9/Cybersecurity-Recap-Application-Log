# Penetration Testing (Recap & Application)

## Overview
Penetration testing involves simulating cyberattacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within networks, applications, or systems — helping organisations strengthen their defences before real attackers can exploit them.  
It forms a key part of proactive cybersecurity and risk management, ensuring compliance with standards such as **ISO 27001**, **NIST**, and **GDPR Article 32** (security of processing).

## Core Skills Recapped
During my degree and ongoing practice, I developed and have since revisited the following areas:
- **Reconnaissance and Enumeration:** Using tools such as **Nmap**, **Dirbuster**, and **theHarvester** to gather open-source intelligence (OSINT) and map network surfaces.  
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Conducting scans with **OpenVAS** or **Nessus** to identify misconfigurations and outdated software.  
- **Exploitation:** Practising safe exploitation within controlled lab environments using **Metasploit** and manual techniques.  
- **Privilege Escalation:** Understanding Windows and Linux privilege paths and post-exploitation techniques.  
- **Reporting:** Creating structured vulnerability reports that include risk ratings, business impact, and remediation advice.

## Tools Used
- **Kali Linux** – Primary testing environment.  
- **Nmap** – Network discovery and port scanning.  
- **Metasploit Framework** – Exploitation and payload testing.  
- **Burp Suite** – Web-application testing and request interception.  
- **OWASP ZAP** – Automated web vulnerability scanning.  
- **TryHackMe / Hack The Box** – Platforms for ethical hacking labs and scenario-based exercises.

## Practical Application / Lab Work
- Completed TryHackMe rooms including *“Pre-Security,” “Network Services,”* and *“OWASP Top 10.”*  
- Conducted a mock penetration test against a vulnerable VM (Metasploitable 2) to identify exploitable services and test mitigation steps.  
- Wrote a short test report outlining findings, risk levels (CVSS), and recommended fixes.  
- Experimented with automated reporting templates and Python scripts to collect scan results.

## SBS Relevance
SBS Insurance Services manages sensitive personal and financial data through web portals and cloud systems.  
Penetration testing skills are directly relevant to:
- Identifying vulnerabilities in **customer portals** and **API endpoints**.  
- Testing **cloud misconfigurations** (e.g., S3 exposure, IAM mis-roles).  
- Validating security controls that protect **claim and fraud-detection data**.  
- Supporting compliance with **GDPR** and **ISO 27001** through regular security assessments.

## Reflection
Recapping these skills has reinforced the importance of approaching tests methodically, documenting every finding, and considering business impact as well as technical severity.  
Moving forward, I aim to:
- Deepen my manual web-application testing skills.  
- Gain greater familiarity with cloud-specific testing (AWS Inspector, ScoutSuite).  
- Improve automated reporting using Python and Markdown.

## Next Steps
-  Complete TryHackMe “Intermediate Penetration Testing” path.  
-  Practise exploit development and post-exploitation scenarios.  
-  Learn more about red-team vs blue-team collaboration.  
-  Continue mapping vulnerabilities to real business impact for future roles.
